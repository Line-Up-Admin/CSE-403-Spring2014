<a name="welcome-to-lineup" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-lineup"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to LineUp.</h3>

<hr><p>LineUp is a versatile, web-based application that can be used to create a virtual line that adds people to the end and removes them, in order, from the front. We have created LineUp in order to to be useful to a wide variety of customers, so look for the option to join your lines using LineUp whenever you are about to partake in a popular activity. By joining your lines through our application, you will find that you spend less time actually standing in line, so that you can get back to your life. Use our QTracks visualization features to see the history of your lines, and you will quickly become a line master, always in the right place at the right time.</p>

<h3>
<a name="using-the-software" class="anchor" href="#using-the-software"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using the Software</h3>

<hr><p>There are multiple methods that you can use to find and join the queues that are of interest to you. Many of our queues are accessible by a direct link that you might find on the organization’s website, meaning that you can join a queue without needing a LineUp account. Alternatively, you can create an account and log in to find a queue of interest by searching through nearby queues using keywords or a location.</p>

<p>The interface of LineUp is designed around the idea that users should have full control of their ability to join and move around in a line, just like you would be able to do in a physical line, without needing to be at the location of the line. Simply enter your name and other optional information into the appropriate boxes in the form, click the “Join" and your position in the line has been recorded. It's that easy! When in a line, you can “Postpone” yourself -- the equivalent of letting one person cut you in a physical line -- or “Leave” the queue altogether.</p>

<p>If your needs include the creation of a queue, LineUp can make the process easy. Our queues are fully customizable and manageable. Choose everything from the name, icon, and size limit, to the multiple users able to dequeue participants from the front of the line. Then, see how your queue is doing with our QTracks analytics.</p>

<p>Our homepage (under construction!) can be found <a href="http://54.186.188.138/#/">here</a>.</p>
